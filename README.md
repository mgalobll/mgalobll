## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

I'm Luka Mgaloblishvili from Tbilisi, Georgia. I'm currently a senior at Union College (NY), pursuing my bachelors degree in Computer Science. 

Through varied and intensive coursework at Union, I have covered core computer science courses while also exploring several different areas and working on several large-scale projects, utilizing a variety of languages and frameworks like Python, Java, Flutter...

I hope to gain more knowledge and experience in the field of computer science outside of Union as well, more specifically, in the areas of Software Development, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Cybersecurity.
